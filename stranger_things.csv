1,THEQUIETGAMER,4.5,"Clearly inspired by the likes of Spielberg, Stephen King, and really any of the great minds behind the best sci-fi and horror of the 80's had to offer, Stranger Things is much more than just a good throwback. It stands out on it's own two feet with an excellent plot and characters. The eight episodes allow for no downtime. Something I can't praise enough. The thrills, chills, twists, and reveals just keep on coming.

One of the main things that works here is that it manages to fit in the human stories to go alongside the more abnormal events happening around these characters town. Every member of the cast is playing a real and complex character. One that is entirely believable. Occasionally their short-tempered ways of speaking to one another do get on your nerves, especially where the kids are concerned, but I still cared about everyone onscreen.

You don't have to be a child of the 80's or familiar with the movies, TV, and other forms of entertainment that inspired this show to enjoy the show. Those sort of things are just kind of an extra pat on the back. Things wrap up satisfyingly, but leave you with just enough questions to keep you coming back. This is just darn good TV and another win for Netflix originals.",5,"After becoming such a smash hit with it's first season, the second season of Stranger Things had big shoes to fill. Suffice to say it more than delivers and gives viewers plenty of reasons to return. Everything you loved about season 1 is still here. Only now the scale is much larger to the point where it's practically overflowing with riches.

I love how it sort of follows the same beats as last season. I found myself noticing how a lot scenes were basically doing the same things we saw last time, only now just bigger and more complex. This sense of déjà vu is able to be appreciated as it feels like the people behind the show are saying ""hey, remember this part you loved in the first season? Well here it is cranked up to eleven!"" Pun intended. It's sort of the show's way of saying that it knows how to make old ideas fresh again and really expresses the Stranger Things creators inventiveness and skill. Of course there are also those moments foreshadowing and outright brilliant tiny scenes that sort of hint at the larger things at play. The near-constant stream of 80's references are still fun.

The emotion and characters are once again spot on. The cast is perfect and their characters are just as lovable as ever. the newcomers fit right in. Seeing them grow and face new issues is just as involving and engrossing as it was the first time around. The new menace is mysterious and adds new elements of horror to the mix. It's an incredibly tense season and will keep you guessing. The action is notably improved.

If you loved season 1 then you'll love this as well. The creator's upped their game and delivered another stellar season. It won't win anyone over who is already on the fence or just flat out didn't like it, but it delivers everything fans could want and surprises us with a whole lot extra. "
2,AARON S,5," The start of an incredible series that continues to impress me. I wasn't there when it first came out, but close to season 2 I checked it out and OH BOY. WHAT A SHOW. It's a perfect blend of 80's nostalgia, incredible characters, superb acting, and flawless storytelling. You can't get any better than this show right here.",5," A near perfect season. It successfully carries on with a fresh story that once again doesn't fail to impress..except for Chapter 7: The Lost Sister. This episode cuts right in the middle of the most tense part of the season. Chapter 6 closed with the demodogs just starting to attack the lab, then we have an entire episode to catch Eleven up with the rest of the characters, and it feels really out of place. In fact, her entire story really isn't that good here. It's good to see her backstory, but Kali and her crew are a bad fit with the show. Otherwise, this season continues with great acting, storytelling, and great new characters like Max and Bob."
3,ANTHONY G,5," The first season of Stranger Things was perfect, it captured that ""movie magic"" vibe and made every episode exciting to watch. The soundtrack was one of the best I've ever heard and I actually went and downloaded it so I could listen to it again. I really enjoyed the relationships the show established and I really liked David Harbour's Chief Hopper character. I wish more shows had this sort of passionate production value.",3.5,"Still a fun season to watch, but a bit of a letdown after the bar was set so high with the first season. I liked that they explored Hopper and Eleven's relationship more, and I really liked Steve's story arc, but I thought the new characters Max, Billy, and Bob were all relatively weak and underdeveloped. I also really didn't like episode 7 and I'm not sure what the point of it was, it just felt really out of place and none of the characters were likeable. I felt like this season could have been structured a little better overall."
4,Brayden S,4.5, Stranger Things is by far one of Netflix's best shows. Very intense and dark and the highlights were the characters and their relationships. Very clever and Finn Wolfhard and Millie Bobby Brown are the stars! This is a series worth a binge,4,Stranger Things comes back at us with another great season. Great performances by the leads and has another very interesting story. The story starts off slow and it takes time to build up but it is worth it. They could have done a better job with the storyline concerning Millie Bobby Brown's character's story as it seems there was no point having it being included! Overall another fun and brilliant season!
5,BRIAN S,4.5,When i started watching this show i didn't know what to expect. It is really different from what i have seen. I really enjoy the Sy-Fy (Sci-Fi) genre very much. This was another show i was hooked on after the first episode.,4," This season was truly different and we got a better look on what the show is about and how the characters really portray themselves. The effects in this season were insane and very well done. The STORY LINE is ""AMAZING"" for a TV series."
6,CALEB H,5," What can I say? Stranger Things should have a slogan to go with the title - The Best Thing on Television. With the recent comeback of all things 80s in music and film, none have done it so well as this superb creation. It achieves what very few films or tv series are able to do - make something so familiar so original and refreshing.",5,"I think it's unfair to compare Season 2 to Season 1 (which was totally tubular) because the element of mystery and surprise is no longer there. For whatever it loses out on to Season 1, the sequel adds on in terms of character development. To think that studios thought the kids would be the weakest link when they are THE reason why this show is so great... it's hard to dislike any character, rather it's now a fight for 'who's your favorite character out of your favorites'. Yes, my friends. Stranger Things 2 is THAT good."
7,CALEB R,5," It took me a while to hop on the train of watching this show, and after watching it, I don't know why I stalled out. This show is fantastic. Not only is it funny, exciting and, at some points, hard to watch, but it also makes you ask questions, and it provokes the mind of the watchers. That is something that I love in shows, because when I'm provoked, then I'm engaged. Great job Netflix.",4.5," Great follow-up season for Stranger Things. Excellent acting, great storytelling, compelling characters and good music. The Mind Flayer was a great addition, though I would have liked to have seen more of it this season. The only issue I have with this season is episode 7, for it felt out of place and like set-up for another show. Other than that, once again, I enjoyed the hell out of this show."
8,CHIYA A,5,"I absolutely love this show, Its like gravity falls but more adult. The way Netflix can release the first season of a show and people like it it could mean stranger things will have an amazing future and it has a lot of good stuff in it like some 80s references and such good moments and so much more. Overall I give stranger things season 1 5/5 stars.",2," I remember having a lot of high hopes for the show after how much I liked stranger things season 1 but instead, they change so much stuff about it like nancy getting drunk or eleven not seeing mike until it's like almost the end of season 2. Also, I found the new character max annoying I felt like she didn't really need to be part of the show but I give this season some credit for how they did the scene with hopper and eleven at the end of the season and the scene with mike and eleven and if you have seen this season 2 you might know what I'm talking about and how they did steve in this season. Overall I give stranger things season 2/5 stars."
9,DANIEL R,5,"The best season so far. The acting, especially from the kids, is phenomenal. The story is mysterious and scary and captivating. I loved the aesthetic it was going for as it was pretty unique for its time and still is even 3/4 years later. Not much to say besides its a must watch.",5,"Not as good as the first season but its still great. The story is a little slower in this one but it still kept its mystery and the fear but still there as there were lots of unknowns. The acting is even better, like they casted these kids amazingly (especially Noah Schnapp, although that bowl cut has got to go). This season just makes you love all the characters even more and it would've been a fitting end to the show, if season three wasn't created."
10,DAVID N,5,"Stranger Things is too addictive to say no to. It's acting has been done with perfection; no line I heard was done terribly and the story was an absolute blessing. And even though the first season wasn't too scary, I simply, loved it.",5," Still perfect. I don't think this could ve done in a better way; well, maybe except for the ""2"" in the title- it could've been another color. That's my only complaint."
11,DEEPS G,4.5,"The season has already started very well, the characters are very captivating and you understand the personality of each one. And why they have this personality sincerely the best series of 2016 …",4.5,The series has evolved a lot over the episodes if it manages to greatly improve what was done in the first season.
12,LUCAS T,2.5," A reasonable season, with good performances, but with impeccable performance by Winona Ryder. I recommend everyone to watch this series. Netflix did a great job!!",5," IMPECTABLE PERFORMANCES once again, a more cohesive story, an even bigger mystery, a MUCH LARGER monster. It is undoubtedly a better sequence than the original and deserves the audience of all. Netflix will have a lot of work to do a season like this!"
13,NICK B,5," This season was so cool! I loved it. It was funny, mysterious, and very fun to watch. The characters are awesome. Dustin, Hopper, Will, Jonathan, and more! The lead villains, the Demogorgon and Dr. Brenner, are very well made and the whole show was very well written. Instant classic for TV.",5," SPOILERS! This is my favorite season of the show. It had lots of cool things, and my favorites, Steve and Dustin actually joined together! The demodogs were awesome, the characters, the story, literally ALL OF IT WAS AWESOME! This is an absolute MUST SEE!"
14,NOAH F,4.5," With horror/mystery elements, an emotionally built story, and strong performances, Stranger Things creates an unforgettable experience, and shows a bright future for the young cast.",4.5,"With an increase of monsters and humor, Stranger Things 2 maintains the elements that made it great, and remains almost as good as it's predecessor season."
15,PARTYFAVOR,4,A good show overall. Although maybe the hype of the people doesn't really help with uplifting the material itself. Not nearly perfect at all but the characters are lovable and the nostalgia it gives is special for me.,3,"I liked this show but not the same love I can give from the first season. The story started strong (I loved the other mutant's storyline) but it felt flat after a while and the pacing of the story became tiresome. The actors are still lovable, but the characters are somewhat not that like-able anymore. What really destroyed this for me is the last scene where it teases another ""possible"" sequel to this mess. It annoyed me that Netflix is just milking this franchise and it will be just a matter of time before it becomes a hot mess."
16,Price P,5," Beautiful, and well crafted. Stranger Things earns its spot for this golden age of television by delivering a beautiful send up to Stephen King and Steven Spielberg with great writing and beautiful performances from Millie Bobby Brown and Winona Ryder.",4.5," Slow but eerie, season 2 delivers with great turns from Noah Schnapp and David Harbour, as well as the continued character development and the addition of Sean Astin, Sadie Sink, and Dacre Montgomery the threats are greater and the suspense continues to build! Despite the 7th episode which left an odd blemish on an otherwise flawless season."
17,RICKY P,4.5,"Stranger Things is mostly nostalgic and derivative but it makes up for it with it's compelling performances, horror elements and a considerable amount of care given to it's characters",4,Stranger Things' second season continues it's great amount of heart and humorous characters even if some episodes start slower then others it's still a satisfying season for fans
18,ROMANA T,5,"Characterization is outstanding! It's like you personally know every single character, simply amazing writing. I don't like all the gorry stuff, but the exciting story more than makes up for it. It's also funny, like laugh out loud funny, at least when you're not crying your eyes out or bleeding your heart for Ms. Byers. This is the most addictive show of all time, well second-most addictive. Doctor Who used to be #1, but since Chibnall took over the writing I can't even watch the show for five minutes without getting bored. Stranger Things just keeps getting better every season. Can't wait for season 4.",5," Stranger Things: Season 2 (2017)  3 months ago This season hit me so hard, it was thrilling and beautifully done. I've had PTSD and this season the writers made it clear they understand this injury like no other I've read or watched before. I've seen movies that try and deal with PTSD and its stranglehold on a person's life and body, but it never felt visceral, on the other hand, Stranger Things hit me right in the gut. It was almost healing to go through all of Will's stages with him and having him survive and win actaully gave me hope. Most shows these days are garbage and can't compare to shows like Doctor Who (before season 11) or movies like classic Star Wars, but Stranger Things does. It's going to be listed among the classics, and on every top ten sci-fi list."
19,SHEPARD B,5,"Really Fun, Great World building, the Acting is Great. And is Emotionally Powerful. Stranger Things Season One is one of the Best Shows I've ever seen.",5,"Like the Season before, Stranger Things 2 has Great World-Building. But this Season can also be really Intense. And One of the Stand-Outs of this Season, is the Relationships, which stands out more in the Next Season. But this Season does not let down at all... Besides Max."
20,SPACEBEAR1,5,"The Duffer Brothers' Stranger Things is probably the BEST television show that I've ever seen. I loved the characters, especially David Harbour's Hopper, I really loved the story, and the music is absolutely flawless. The show has perfect pacing and a very eerie tone. I also thought the design for the monster, the Demogorgon, was great as well as the use of practical effects. In the end, I honestly can't tell you how great this show was...because it's amazing.",5,"The Duffer Brothers' Stranger Things 2 is an AMAZING follow up/sequel to the previous season. I once again loved the characters. David Harbour was once again amazing. I was also very surprised with the amount of development with Joe Keery's character Steve. He was almost unbearable for a little more than half of the previous season and a bit better by the finale but he has easily become my favorite character in this show. I also loved the design for the new monster, the Mind Flayer, but also the new army of Demodogs. I only have one problem with this season, which was the entirety of episode seven. In the end, I actually loved this season more than the first."
21,THEDAYWALKER,4.5,"I really had to watch it, because it was what everyone was talking about, but i was not disappointed, a really great season, that kept and is still keeping me guessing, can't wait to see more",4.5,"I have to say, after the almost perfection of season 1, i didn't expect season 2 to be either better or even just as good.
But i think they stepped up their game, giving characters more to do and the children remain as naive as before. The story is better told and the acting is a step up as well.
I don't understand the Dacre Montgomery character's inclusion, because right now he was there to make Steve look like a good guy and to be a douche to MadMax."
22,TIM L,3.5, This show hits a lot of nostalgia right out the gate. From the cheesy opening sequence that totally nails the 80's TV show look and feel. The story is both good and mysterious and has you interested right away. They even cast kids you'd expect to see in an 80's flick or show. This is definitely worth the watch.,1, The first season was a slam dunk but season 2 goes off the rails. Too many bad moves and bad plot twist. It lost what the first season cultivated easily. Stopped watching.
23,User A,5,"A wonderful series with incredibly lively and beautiful characters. The whole season has been viewed in the same breath. Winona Ryder, David Harbour and child actors have perfectly coped with their roles.",5," The second season did not lag behind the first season, and even surpassed it in some THINGS. This is still a pleasant, exciting and incredibly interesting series."
24,VINNY M,5," Great TV series especially if you're into sci fi/80's/and monsters and that's everything I love so I give it a 5/5 if i could i'd give it a 10/5 but I consider it great and a classic and I honestly think that it's better than Game of Thrones, The Sopranos, and Breaking Bad! And it's netflix's best tv show!",4.5,Not as good as the 1st it's still very rewatchable though and it's a pretty good continuation and sequel to the 1st! The last 2 episodes were very good though!
